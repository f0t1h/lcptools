/**
 * @file lps.h
 * @brief Defines the lps struct and its associated methods for handling locally consistent
 * parsing (LCP) of strings.
 *
 * The lps struct is responsible for performing LCP operations on input strings, constructing
 * cores, and supporting functionalities like parsing, compression (deepening), and memory
 * usage calculations. It includes methods for reading and writing the data to files as well
 * as deepening the LCP to higher levels of compression.
 *
 * The lps struct leverages various helper classes like core, encoding, and hash to manage the
 * string data and its compressed forms. Additionally, it supports both standard and
 * reverse-complement parsing for specialized string handling in bioinformatics and other fields.
 *
 * Key functionalities include:
 * - Parsing an input string or file to extract LCP cores.
 * - Performing multi-level compression of LCP cores (deepening).
 * - Saving and loading LCP cores from files.
 * - Calculating memory usage of the constructed LCP structure.
 *
 * Dependencies:
 * - Requires core.h, encoding.h, hash.h, and constant.h for auxiliary data structures and utilities.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * @code
 *   std::string sequence = "AGCTAGCTAG";
 *   lcp::lps parser(sequence);
 *   parser.deepen();
 *   parser.write("output.lps");
 * @endcode
 *
 * @see core.h
 * @see encoding.h
 * @see hash.h
 * @see constant.h
 *
 * @namespace lcp
 * @struct lps
 *
 * @note Destructor handles clean-up of allocated memory for cores.
