# `lps` Data Structure Documentation

The `lps` data structure is designed for efficient parsing and representation of strings with advanced features such as reverse complement transformations, offset-based indexing, and binary file serialization/deserialization. 

This document provides detailed instructions on initializing, using, and managing the `lps` data structure.

---

## Overview

The `lps` structure is composed of two main components:

1. **`lps` structure**: Represents the main object with attributes like `level`, `size`, and an array of `core` objects.
2. **`core` structure**: Represents the individual elements stored in the `lps`, with attributes for bit representation, labels, and positional information.

### Struct Definitions
```c
struct lps {
    int level;
    int size;
    struct core *cores;
};

struct core {
    ubit_size bit_size;  // Size of the bit representation
    ublock *bit_rep;     // Pointer to the bit representation
    ulabel label;        // Unique label for the core
    uint64_t start;      // Start index in the string
    uint64_t end;        // End index in the string
};
```

### Memory Management

#### `free_lps`
Frees dynamically allocated memory associated with an `lps` object.

**Parameters**:
- `struct lps *lps_ptr`: Pointer to the `lps` object to free.

**Usage**:
```c
free_lps(&my_lps);

---

### File Operations

#### `write_lps`
Serializes and writes an `lps` object to a binary file.

**Parameters**:
- `struct lps *lps_ptr`: Pointer to the `lps` object to write.
- `FILE *out`: File pointer to the binary file for writing.

**Usage**:
```c
FILE *output_file = fopen("lps_data.bin", "wb");
write_lps(&my_lps, output_file);
fclose(output_file);
```

# Alphabet Encoding

This section provides functions to manage the encoding of standard DNA bases (A, C, G, T) and their complements, used in the Locally Consistent Parsing (LCP) tool. Please note that any custom alphabet encoding can be provided to the program.

## Functions

### ``LCP_SUMMARY``
   - **Description**: Displays the summary of the alphabet encoding, including coefficients and dictionary bit size. This function helps you understand the encoding setup and verify that the parameters are correctly configured.
   - **Usage**: Simply call `LCP_SUMMARY()` to print the encoding details to the console.
   
```c
void LCP_SUMMARY();
```

---

### ``LCP_INIT``
   - **Description**: Initializes the encoding coefficients for the standard DNA bases (A, C, G, T) and their complements. The function sets default values for the coefficients and dictionary bit size.
   - **Usage**: Call `LCP_INIT()` to initialize the encoding with the default values.
   
```c
void LCP_INIT();
```

---

### ``LCP_INIT2``
   - **Description**: Initializes the encoding coefficients for standard DNA bases (A, C, G, T) and their reverse complements. Sets default values for coefficients and dictionary bit size. The verbosity of the output can be controlled by the `verbose` parameter:
     - If `verbose` is 0, no encoding summary will be printed.
     - If `verbose` is 1, the encoding summary is printed after initialization.
   - **Usage**: Call `LCP_INIT2(0)` or `LCP_INIT2(1)` based on whether you want the encoding summary printed.
   
```c
void LCP_INIT2(int verbose);
```

---

### ``LCP_INIT_FILE``
   - **Description**: Initializes the encoding coefficients by reading them from a file. The file must contain three columns: the character (DNA base), the encoding value, and the complement encoding value for each base. After initializing the encoding coefficients, the function prints the encoding summary if `verbose` is set to 1.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `filename`: The path to the file containing the character encodings. The file format should have the following columns: character (A, C, G, T), encoding value, and complement encoding value.
     - `verbose`: If true (1), the encoding summary will be printed after initialization. If false (0), no summary will be printed.
   - **Returns**: Always returns 0 upon successful initialization.
   - **Throws**: `std::invalid_argument` if any invalid data is found in the file (e.g., missing or incorrect entries).
   - **Usage**: Call `LCP_INIT_FILE("path/to/encoding_file.txt", 1)` to initialize the encoding from a file and print the summary.
   
```c
int LCP_INIT_FILE(const char *filename, int verbose);
```

## File Format for LCP_INIT_FILE

The file for initializing encoding should be in the following format:

```
A 0 1
C 1 0
G 2 3
T 3 2
```

Where:
- The first column represents the DNA base (A, C, G, T).
- The second column represents the encoding value.
- The third column represents the complement encoding value.

---

## Example Workflow

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "lps.h"

int main() {
    LCP_INIT();

    struct lps my_lps;

    // Initialize from a string
    init_lps(&my_lps, "ACGTACGT", 8);

    // Serialize to a file
    FILE *output_file = fopen("lps_data.bin", "wb");
    write_lps(&my_lps, output_file);
    fclose(output_file);

    // Free memory
    free_lps(&my_lps);

    // Deserialize from a file
    FILE *input_file = fopen("lps_data.bin", "rb");
    init_lps3(&my_lps, input_file);
    fclose(input_file);

    // Free memory again
    free_lps(&my_lps);

    return 0;
}
```

---

## Notes
- The encoding coefficients define how each DNA base and its complement are represented internally. These values are essential for performing efficient parsing and comparison of DNA sequences.
- Ensure that the encoding file is properly formatted to avoid errors during initialization.
- Always ensure memory is freed after use to avoid leaks.
- Use valid and open binary files for serialization/deserialization functions.
- Offset and complement functions provide advanced features for genomic data analysis.
